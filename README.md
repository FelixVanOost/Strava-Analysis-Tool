# Strava Analysis Tool
A Python tool to analyse and display Strava activity data.

## Installation

### Dependencies
The tool is developed with Python 3.7.4. Its depedencies are tracked in ```requirements.txt``` (for Pip) and ```spec-file.txt``` (for the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) distribution).

Anaconda is recommended for Windows users as it comes pre-installed with many of the common packages required by the tool. It is the preferred method from which to install ```GeoPandas```, which is leveraged for the processing of geospatial activity data. See the GeoPandas [Installation](http://geopandas.org/install.html) page for more information.
